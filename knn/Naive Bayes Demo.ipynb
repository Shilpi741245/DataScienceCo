Naive Bayes is one of the simplest algorithms. But it is not very easy to implement. Because to find individual probabilities, you have to separate the different classes, then for each feature in each class, you have to find the probability of each value of feature.\n","\n","\n","Attribute Information: (classes: edible=e, poisonous=p)\n","\n","cap-shape: bell=b,conical=c,convex=x,flat=f, knobbed=k,sunken=s\n","\n","cap-surface:
